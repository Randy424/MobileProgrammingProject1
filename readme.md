We always tested it when we had internet.
We used primarily a Nexus 4 on API 21.

Some logins already made:
randy:p
will@will.com:password
alice@alice.com:password


Logout functionality is not implemented, if you login or register then back all the way out to login in the same session and attempt to login or register with a different user you may get undefined behavior.

(Please see powerpoint in this directory as well.)
